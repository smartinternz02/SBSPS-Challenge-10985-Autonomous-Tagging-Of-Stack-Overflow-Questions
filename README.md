# SBSPS-Challenge-10985-Autonomous-Tagging-Of-Stack-Overflow-Questions
Autonomous-Tagging-Of-Stack-Overflow-Questions
We present a system that is able to automatically assign tags to the question from question-answering site stackoverflow.
We propose a multi-label classification system that automatically tags users question to  enhance user experience.
We implement a one-vs-rest classifier for a stack overflow dataset, using a linear SVM and a carefully chosen subset of the entire feature set explored
